The goal of this set of documents is to provide a place where people can learn all about javascript popups.

To begin, I will make very basic demonstrations on how to create pure js popups so others can learn from them and use them more effectively in their own projects.

After the pure js I will learn JQuery and other libraries / frameworks that enable popups to be implemented.
